        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p>Everyone can benefit from counselling at one time or another in their life. We have all had times where we have felt sad, anxious, 
		unhappy or unsettled and are unsure who we can talk to. Talking to a professional counsellor or psychotherapist can help provide 
		you with the time and space to look at, reflect and potentially change things that are troubling you.</p>

          <h3>Qualifications</h3>
          <p>In my practice I use a combination of Person Centred approaches, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, Transtheoretical Model, 
		  Compassion Focus Therapy, and Attachment, amongst others. This combination makes me well equipped to work with a wide variety 
		  of issues that may trouble a client. I aim to develop a comfortable, trusting and friendly environment by working in a non-judgemental, 
		  understanding and empathetic manner. </p>
